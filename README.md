# Exercise Personal Portfolio React

Having a portfolio or personal website is a great tool for personal branding, but for software developers it has a special meaning because it allows us to share your most valuable work in an organize matter.

## Objetive

A personal portfolio its like a Resume (CV) on steroides, you can make it as interactive/cool/beautiful as you want but don't loose focus on the main objective: Showcasing your yourself, professional acomplishments and most important projects.

> Quality is more important than quantity, specially since you are starting a new career and you don't have much projects to showcase.

## But you don't have any projects

A portfolio is a live webiste, you can change it any time, you have to plan for the future. 

Don't worry about not having projects, you can start with one and you'll grow from there. Everyone started from scratch! In matter of months you will have a couple of projects.

## Typical structure

The following

- Small bio about yourself: Find a short -not boring- way to talk about yourself: What makes you yourself? Any hobbies or passions? Try not to write more than 250 characters here.
- Skills: Software development is a technical skillset, you need to specify your specialty areas like: React, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, Python, Flask, Databases, etc. It's a good idea to also specify how "expert" you feel on each of them (like a progress bar or a number form one to ten).
- Projects: Each project must have a picture, small description a link to the live link and another link to the github profile.
- Contact section: You social media, email and you can also include a small form using a service like netlify, foxyform, etc.

## Where do I start?

### Research

Let's start by doing some research, what portfolio do you like the most? Here is a few examples: 

| Link                            | Description     | Why we like it                                                                        |

### Find your template

You can look on the internet for free HTML/CSS templates and you can adapt them to react very easy as long as they don't contain the following:

1. Avoid complicated effects using Javascript like Parallax or animations.
2. Make sure they use little or no Javascript, the javascript part will be a lot harder to migrate to React, you can include animations later using React.js animation libraries like [React Spring](https://www.react-spring.io/docs/hooks/examples) or [Framer Motion later](https://www.framer.com/motion/).
